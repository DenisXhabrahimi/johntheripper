John the Ripper Cybersecurity Project

This project involves using John the Ripper, a powerful password cracking tool, to analyze and test the strength of password hashes in a cybersecurity context. Developed as part of a school project, this tool is used to demonstrate the vulnerabilities of weak password practices and the importance of secure hashing algorithms. Key features include:

Password Cracking: Leverages John the Ripper to attempt cracking password hashes using various techniques such as dictionary attacks, brute-force, and rule-based cracking.
Hash Algorithm Support: Supports multiple hash algorithms, including MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and more, to analyze different types of password hashes.
Dictionary & Wordlist Customization: Customizable wordlists and rules for more targeted password cracking, including the ability to generate wordlists based on specific patterns.
GPU Acceleration: Uses GPU-powered cracking to speed up the process when analyzing large datasets or complex hashes.
Security Awareness: Demonstrates the importance of using strong, unique passwords and secure hashing methods to mitigate vulnerabilities in real-world systems.
Educational Tool: Provides valuable insight into how attackers might approach cracking passwords, helping students understand and address security flaws in password management.
